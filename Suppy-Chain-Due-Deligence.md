## 1. Introduction & Scope
This document helps organisations implement structured supply chain due diligence to identify and mitigate ESG, legal, operational and reputational risks posed by suppliers and third parties.

**Applies to:** Procurement, Legal, Compliance, Sustainability, Risk & Audit teams.  
**Use for:** Onboarding, periodic reviews, pre-tender assessments, high-risk suppliers, M&A vendor reviews.

---

## 2. Key Concepts & Regulatory Context
- **Due Diligence** — process to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate and account for actual and potential adverse impacts in the supply chain.  
- **Human Rights & Labour** — child labour, forced labour, wages, working hours, health & safety.  
- **Environment** — emissions, hazardous substances, waste, water, biodiversity risks.  
- **Anti-Corruption & Ethics** — bribery, facilitation payments, conflicts of interest.  
- **Regulatory Drivers (examples)** — EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) proposals, national supply chain laws (e.g., Germany’s LkSG), OECD due diligence guidance, UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights (UNGPs).

> **Note:** Always check local/national laws relevant to doing business; tailor questionnaires and clauses accordingly.

---

## 3. Supply Chain Due Diligence Framework (High Level)
1. **Governance & Policy** — adopt supplier code of conduct and procurement policies.  
2. **Mapping** — identify suppliers, tiers, spend, criticality, geography.  
3. **Risk Assessment** — score suppliers for inherent & residual risks.  
4. **Due Diligence** — perform desktop checks, questionnaires, audits.  
5. **Contractual Controls** — DPAs, ESG clauses, audit & termination rights.  
6. **Remediation** — corrective action plans, escalation, support.  
7. **Monitoring** — KPIs, periodic reassessment, reporting to leadership.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Due Diligence Process

### 4.1 Map & Prioritise Suppliers (Mapping)
**Deliverable:** Supplier master list with tier, spend, service type, location, and criticality.

**Actions:**
- Extract supplier data from ERP/Procurement systems.  
- Classify suppliers by tier (Tier 1 = direct, Tier 2+ = indirect/sub-suppliers).  
- Tag by industry, product type, geography, and single-supplier dependencies.  
- Identify *critical* suppliers (high spend, single source, regulated sectors, strategic).

**Columns to capture:** Supplier name, country, contact, products/services, annual spend, contract start/end, criticality, data processing (yes/no).

---

### 4.2 Risk Assessment & Scoring (Assessment)
**Objective:** Prioritise for further due diligence.

**Risk Factors (sample):**
- Geography risk (country-level governance, conflict zones).  
- Industry risk (mining, apparel, electronics higher).  
- Product risk (chemical handling, medical devices).  
- Labour practices history (violations, strikes).  
- Environmental footprint (hazardous processes, emissions).  
- Financial stability (insolvency risk).  
- Corruption perception.

**Outcome:** Score (e.g., 1–100) and risk band (Low/Medium/High/Critical). High-risk suppliers → detailed DD & contractual controls.

---

### 4.3 Desktop/Lite Checks & Red Flags
**Desktop checks:**  
- Public records (press, sanctions lists, litigation).  
- Company filings, registries, beneficial ownership.  
- Compliance databases (sanctions, PEP lists).  
- Media/NGO reports.  
- Social media signals.

**Red flags:**  
- Lack of corporate transparency.  
- History of labour or environmental violations.  
- Sanctions or regulatory actions.  
- Complex ownership structures.  
- Unrealistic pricing or unreliable delivery history.

---

### 4.4 Detailed Due Diligence (DD) & Onsite Audits
**Detailed DD includes:**  
- Completed supplier questionnaire (see template).  
- Document review: policies, certifications (ISO, SA8000, FSC), audit reports.  
- Interviews with supplier management.  
- Remote assessments (virtual tours).  
- Onsite audits for high-risk suppliers: facility inspection, worker interviews, traceability checks.

**Audit scope checklist:** health & safety, wages & hours, child labour, environmental permits, hazardous waste handling, subcontractor controls, grievance mechanisms.

---

### 4.5 Contractual Controls & Clauses
Key contractual protections:
- **Supplier Code of Conduct** (attach as schedule).  
- **Audit rights** (including access to records & facilities).  
- **Breach & remediation obligations** with timelines.  
- **Termination for material ESG breaches.**  
- **Indemnities & limited liability** tailored to ESG breaches.  
- **Data Processing Agreement (if personal data processed).**  
- **Anti-corruption & sanctions compliance clause.**  
- **Subcontracting & flow-down obligations** (ensure sub-supplier compliance).

*See [Section 8](#8-sample-contract-clauses-dpa-esg-audit-rights) for ready-to-use clauses.*

---

### 4.6 Remediation Plans & CAPA
When issues are found:
- **Categorise severity** (Minor / Major / Critical).  
- **Issue Corrective Action Plan (CAPA)** with owner, action, completion date, verification steps.  
- **Support**: Provide supplier training or resources where feasible.  
- **Escalate**: Re-evaluate business relationship if non-compliance persists; suspend or terminate supply if critical.

---

### 4.7 Monitoring, KPIs & Continuous Improvement
**KPI examples:**  
- % of suppliers assessed for ESG risk.  
- % of high-risk suppliers audited.  
- Time to close CAPAs.  
- % suppliers with published sustainability policies.  
- % spend covered by ESG-assessed suppliers.

**Reporting cadence:** Monthly operational reports; quarterly management; annual board reporting.

---

## 5. Risk Matrix & Scoring Model (Template)
Use a weighted scoring approach. Example weights:

| Factor | Weight (%) |
|--------|------------|
| Country/geography risk | 20 |
| Sector risk | 15 |
| Product/process risk | 15 |
| Labour & human rights risk | 15 |
| Environmental risk | 15 |
| Financial viability | 10 |
| Governance & transparency | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

**Scoring scale** for each factor: 0 (low) — 5 (very high). Multiply score by weight, sum, normalize to 0–100.

**Risk bands:**  
- 0–30 Low  
- 31–50 Medium  
- 51–75 High  
- 76–100 Critical
